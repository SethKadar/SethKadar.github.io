<p> This two-dimensinal Rubik's Cube was created my Shuichi and Seth as our final project for CSC 106. We started with this idea because of our interest in the Rubik's Cube as well as the complexity of the project. We knew that making this composite program would be challenging but we chased the idea regardless. </p>
<p> Using the directional arrows surrounding the cube, the user can mix up the Rubik's Cube and resolve it. This program is more difficult to solve compared to an ordinary 3-D Rubik's Cube because of the necessary abstract visualization. We hope that the user enjoys solving our Rubik's Cube! </p>
